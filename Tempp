FB Group Poster

A lightweight, mobile-first React app that helps you copy a unique ad for each Facebook group and jump straight to that group’s page for manual posting.
No automation. No scraping. No account access. Just one-tap convenience for humans who still do the clicking themselves.

🧩 CSV Format

Group Name	Group URL	Ad

Tip: Always include the header row. The app tolerates small variations, but “Group Name / Group URL / Ad” is safest.

📱 iPhone Tips
	•	After tapping Copy & Open, long-press in the Facebook post composer and select Paste.
	•	If a new tab doesn’t open, disable the pop-up blocker or turn off “Open group after copy.”
	•	Safari sometimes blocks clipboard reads; don’t panic — paste manually.

⚠️ Disclaimer

This app does not automate Facebook posting, scraping, or logging in.
It’s a clipboard assistant — you still control every post.

Facebook’s UI and policies change often. If they break your flow, complain to Facebook, not to this poor app.
